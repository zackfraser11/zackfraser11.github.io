            <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello, my name is Zackary Fraser and this is my website for CSC 106. I am currently a sophmore majoring in Computer Science after deciding to switch out of Computer Engineering. I was born and raised in Warwick, Rhode Island and still currently live there off of campus. I don't have too much knowledge in code but I am looking forward to learning a skill that will help me take off in my career!
                    </p>
                <p>I grew up playing just about every sport you can think of but when I got to high school I stopped playing most. Although, I decided to play volleyball and I liked it a lot. I made first team all state senior year at Bishop Hendricken High School and my team finished second, losing to Coventry in the finals. I love every Boston sports team there is, except for baseball, I'm not the biggest fan of it.
