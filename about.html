            <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello, my name is Zackary Fraser and this is my website for CSC 106. I am currently a sophmore majoring in Computer Science after deciding to switch out of Computer Engineering. I was born and raised in Warwick, Rhode Island and still currently live there off of campus. I don't have too much knowledge in code but I am looking forward to learning a skill that will help me take off in my career!
                    </p>
